WaveBoard's Angular Web Client
==============

WaveBoard turns any monitor into a "jumbotron" that showcases recent social media tagged with any term you provide. Visualizations include a montage of recent and incoming instagram photos, a carousel of recent and incoming tweets, and a 'king of the hill' view of the latest tweet.

This WaveBoard client accesses the API provided by an API service we also authored, the [WaveBoard API service](https://github.com/MediaDash/api_wrappers).
